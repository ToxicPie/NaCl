- Pre-submit:
  - Did you make a typo when copying a template?
  - Test more cases if unsure.
    - Write a naive solution and check small cases.
  - Submit the correct file.

- General Debugging:
  - Read the whole problem again.
  - Have a teammate read the problem.
  - Have a teammate read your code.
    - Explain you solution to them (or a rubber duck).
  - Print the code and its output / debug output.
  - Go to the toilet.

- Wrong Answer:
  - Any possible overflows?
    - > `__int128` ?
    - Try `-ftrapv` or `#pragma GCC optimize("trapv")`
  - Floating point errors?
    - > `long double` ?
    - turn off math optimizations
    - check for `==`, `>=`, `acos(1.000000001)`, etc.
  - Did you forget to sort or unique?
  - Generate large and worst "corner" cases.
  - Check your `m` / `n`, `i` / `j` and `x` / `y`.
  - Are everything initialized or reset properly?
  - Are you sure about the STL thing you are using?
    - Read cppreference (should be available).
  - Print everything and run it on pen and paper.

- Time Limit Exceeded:
  - Calculate your time complexity again.
  - Does the program actually end?
    - Check for `while(q.size())` etc.
  - Test the largest cases locally.
  - Did you do unnecessary stuff?
    - e.g. pass vectors by value
    - e.g. `memset` for every test case
  - Is your constant factor reasonable?

- Runtime Error:
  - Check memory usage.
    - Forget to clear or destroy stuff?
    - > `vector::shrink_to_fit()`
  - Stack overflow?
  - Bad pointer / array access?
    - Try `-fsanitize=address`
  - Division by zero? NaN's?
